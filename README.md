# Code Inst. Milestone Project 01 - Personal Site built with Boostrap

## Synopsis
The purpose of the website is present the skills I have learned in building a responsive, mobile-first website. It demonstrates how I used HTML and CSS to create a website that dynamically changes layout structure based on the current users screen size while retaining a positive UX design and aesthetic. 

Itâ€™s second goal is to present information regarding me and my previous work to the public. To build on the promotional material online that represents me and my abilities to any prospective employer. It allows users to preview samples of my previous work and then direct them to live versions of working content. It allows users to connect to my github and linked-in profiles but also via a php mailer form.

## Functionality
The website is fully responsive, on desktop and larger screen sizes the structure is changed to allow better functionality by changing the location of buttons. All pages have a nav bar, banner, content and a footer.

The navigation is a customed bootstrap solution with links to four pages. The banner is fully responsive showing a large logo on mobile screens and smaller on ipad an desktop. 

The content consists of four pages. They are About, Corporate Work, Games and Contact. While each page contains links to samples of my work or prevois clients, the contact page is a php mailer form that will not opperate on the github pages but is live at 3rdcastle.com

The footer consists of a banner and some ways to contact me directly. The footer banner is mostly a client list that allows users to link the various companies I've provided services for in the past. Below that are links to my Linked-In and GitHub accounts.

## Technologies Used

CSS3
Bootstrap
GIT

Google Chrome developer tools

## Deployment

The website was built using the Gitpod IDE and later the WebStorm IDE. An online Github.com repository was used but change to a local GIT directory. Both used version control and then saved/uploaded to Github. Because the site uses php it was deployed to a cpanel webserver and can be viewed at https://www.3rdcastle.com

## Installation

Copy the site folder . 

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
All pages and functionality were testing using the chrome web developer tools with the following screen size layouts: Galaxy S5, Pixel2, Pixel2(XL), iPhone 5/SE, iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone 6/7/8 Plus, iPhone X, iPad,  iPad, and the following standard screen width 480, 600, 768, 992, and 1382px.
